# 🚀 Faasen’s Python Playground

Welcome to my growing collection of Python mini-projects, practice files, and scripts.  
This repo documents my journey from beginner to advanced — one file, one lesson, one breakthrough at a time.

## 🧠 About This Repository

This repo includes:
- 🔤 **String & text manipulation**
- 📊 **List, tuple, and dictionary practice**
- 🔁 **Loops, conditions, and logic flow**
- 🔐 **Authentication + user input projects**
- ⚙️ **Functions and modular code (coming soon)**
- 📁 **More advanced projects as I grow**

Whether it's exercises from books like _Python Crash Course_ or original experiments, this is where I sharpen my skills.
