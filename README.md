# Python Crash Course Projects

This repository contains my practice files from working through the book **"Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes** (3rd Edition).

Each script explores a core Python concept such as:
- Variables and Strings
- Lists and Tuples
- Loops and Conditional Statements
- Functions and Modules
- Slicing, Copying, and Stripping Data
